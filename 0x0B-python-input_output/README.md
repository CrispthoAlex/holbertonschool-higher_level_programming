# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

G## eneral
* Why Python programming is awesome (dont forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* How to open a file
* How to write text in a file
* How to read the full content of a file
* How to read a file line by line
* How to move the cursor in a file
* How to make sure a file is closed after using it
* What is and how to use the with statement
* What is JSON
* What is serialization
* What is deserialization
* How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
* How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

# Requirements
## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ``#!/usr/bin/python3``
* A ``README.md`` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the ``PEP 8`` style (version 1.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ``wc``

# Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: ``python3 -m doctest ./tests/*``
* All your modules should have a documentation (``python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'``)
* All your classes should have a documentation (``python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'``)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (``python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'``)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you dont miss any edge case
